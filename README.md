A collection of Exabeam queries to be used for threat hunting & detection

Note: Some of these fields being used in published queries may be differ in your environment depending on parsing used in the Exabeam instance. Please test these queries in your environment/Exabeam instance.

I encourage any contribution of hunting/detection rules to the respository and would love to colloborate on some queries!
